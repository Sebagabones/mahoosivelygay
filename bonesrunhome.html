			<h2>The server that runs a whole lot of nothing</h2>
			<p>
				bonesrunhome is an IBM x3550 M4 - it currently is sitting on my desk in
				my bedroom, so I have a lovely 1U space heater
			</p>
			<p>
				I wound up with it as UCC (UWA's
				<a href="https://ucc.asn.au">University Computer Club</a>) was throwing
				out a bunch of them due to the unfortunate habit they had of kamikazing
				themselves. Thankfully there was one remaining that hadn't blown up and
				with a firmware update it should hopefully not blow up anytime soon :P
			</p>
			<p>
				It currently has two Xeon E5-2697 v2's (24 total cores at 3.50GHz) and
				384GB of RAM with Alma linux as it's operating system, however the end
				goal for this server is to buy a rack (I now have a rack! See
				<a href="myRack.html">myRack</a>) and move it into my living room (sorry
				housemates), chuck in a number of SSD's for storage (I may also add a
				10Gbps nic too) - and then I'll need to find something to run on it lol.
				I will probably turn this into my main server, replacing
				<a href="bonescallhome.html">bonescallhome </a> (due to this being a
				fair bit more powerful) and end up converting bonescallhome into a
				pfsense router.
