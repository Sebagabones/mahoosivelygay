My personal website, with minimal Javascript because I prefer a lightweight simple website.

This is setup to use [SSRI](https://github.com/Sebagabones/Server-Side-Rendered-Includes) as a templating tool.

Available [here](https://mahoosively.gay/).

My emacs config files are not in this repo as my current setup involves them being processed by ssri on my webserver, and being chucked onto the webserver by Capistrano (as these are generated semi often with pygments whenever the config files are changed)
