			Heya! I'm Seb, and my pronouns are they/them. I'm studying
			computer science at UWA, and this is my attempt at a (low effort) personal website.

			<h4>A list of my (constantly) changing projects</h4>
			<details open>
				<summary>Software</summary>
				<p><i>Full warning, the following will almost immediately be out of date, but I'll do my best to keep it
						updated - if in doubt, check my <a href="https://github.com/Sebagabones">Github</a>. </i></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A RedwoodJS website for better management of <a href="https://ucc.asn.au">UCC</a>'s member VM's,
						replacing the Proxmox UI. This started out as a Pulumi project to speed up VM creation, and
						while that may still be part of that in the CI side of it, I am now planning to probably try to
						just use the Proxmox API.
					</li>
					<li>
						Theming for KDE's Labplot, to add Catppuccin themes to it - this will hopefully be finished
						soon<sup>tm</sup>. In true fashion, it all works, I am just running into the classic issue where
						finishing the last 10% of the documentation is harder than the rest of it was. If you want to
						try it out,
						my repository is <a href=https://github.com/Sebagabones/labplot>here</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						The <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/vimium">Vimium Catppuccin port</a> which I maintain
						(which, to be honest, has needed very little maintenance so far).
					</li>
					<li>
						My <a href="emacsFiles.html">Emacs config files</a> - apparently I am weird because I used Emacs
						in the terminal lol. I use Doom Emacs because I am lazy, which is why my files may look
						different to yours lol (yes this isn't really related to Software but I was running out of
						things to include that weren't uni related).
					</li>
					<li>
						Which, speaking of university assignments, a particular favourite of mine was the second
						assessment in High Performance Computing - while I probably <i>shouldn't</i> openly show my code
						due to personal doubts on the unit content changing, I can still show off my <a href="report.html">report</a>!
						Be warned, this is genuinly one of the daftest ways
						I have spent my time.

					</li>
				</ul>
			</details>

				<summary>Hardware</summary>
				<ul>
					<li>
						An X270 thinkpad that is running FreeBSD, which I have been slowly
						upgrading with a new IPS FHD screen, new larger batteries, a 1TB
						Samsung M.2 SSD and 16GB of ram. Alas, after writing some incredibly fun scripts to avoid the
						forsaken
						BD-PROCHOT, I have pretty much stopped using it lol.
					</li>
					<li>
						An x201 thinkpad that is running Alpine Linux with i3 (yes I know -
						I'm falling down the rabbit hole even more) - this has been upgraded
						as far as it can go (8 GB of ram let's go). This has also been phased out of regular use, mostly
						due
						to
						the screen being borderline painful to use.
					</li>

					<li>
						An IBM x3200 M3 server (<a href="bonescallhome.html">bonescallhome</a>) which is no longer
						hosting
						this
						webpage - in fact, this is no longer even at my house! I found it too sensible, and so in true
						fashion
						for myself, I gave it to a friend.
					</li>

					<li>
						An IBM x3550 M4 server (<a href="bonesrunhome.html">bonesrunhome</a>)
						which is running a few VMs (including a debian VM which is dedicated
						to web-hosting)
					</li>

					<li>
						A project that has now been put on the back burner: a Toshiba T3200 -
						this has a whopping 4MBs of ram, with a 40MB hard drive. Currently it
						isn't booting, and so my focus is to fix/replace the floppy disk drive
						(this is very much on the back burner on account of it now no longer
						turning on lol - unsure why, but it seems I may have let the magic
						smoke out- hopefully I'll fix it one day)
					</li>
					<li>
						A ThinkPad 770z running Tiny Core Linux. This has had it's hard drive (an IBM <s>Deskstar</s>
						Deathstar
						that had started rattling) replaced with an SD card, and was an adventure in finding a Distro
						that
						supported such an old CPU. I setup some sort of window manager on it, iirc IceWM, and have
						promptly
						not
						used it since.
					</li>
					<li>
						An IBM x3650 M2 (<a href="bonescrawlhome.html">bonescrawlhome</a>). This is not and will never
						be
						used -
						if you live in perth and want it hmu
						lmao.
					</li>

					<li>
						Another (short-lived) acquisition is an IBM
						<a href="Power7.html"> Power 750 Express.</a>
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="bonesboundhome.html">bonesboundhome</a> an IBM x3650 M4 that is running as my secondary
						server
						alongside <a href="bonesrunhome.html">bonesrunhome</a>.
					</li>

					<li>
						I also have an IBM bladecenter H, but I have no idea what I will ever
						use it for - this may be destined to die a horrible death soon, mostly due to the fact that <a
							href="https://ucc.asn.au">UCC</a> tries to
						murder me whenever it starts up.
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="myRack.html">The server rack</a> that is currently heating
						my living room.
					</li>
