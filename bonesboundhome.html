			<h2>The almost sensible server</h2>
			<p>bonesboundhome is an IBM x3650 M4</p>
			<p>
				I grabbed it from some random business off marketplace, and with a
				firmware update it hopefuly won't blow up anytime soon lol
			</p>
			<p>
				It currently has two Xeon E5-2650's and 384GB of RAM with Alma Linux
				(with bedrock linux lmao) as an operating system and the end goal is to
				add a Nvidia Tesla P4 (or two) and a number of SSD's for storage (I may
				also add a 10Gbps nic too)
			</p>
			<p>
				I also have written a custom fan curve for this in C - which I will
				eventually add to my github - although I did write a version of it in
				python for bonesrunhome, which is alive and well on my github.
