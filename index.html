				So, uh, I guess this is my website - excuse how it looks - I haven't

			<h3>An about me:</h3>
			<p>
				Heya! I go by Seb, and my pronouns are they/them. I am studying
				comp-sci, and my current projects (which, tbh, are ever changing), are
				(kinda) listed below:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					An X270 thinkpad that is running EndeavourOS, which I have been slowly
					upgrading with a new IPS FHD screen, new larger batteries, a 1TB
					Samsung M.2 SSD and 16GB of ram - this is slowly replacing my daily
					driver (a nice, fast, albeit very standard, ASUS Zenbook 13 flip),
					even though the Zenbook is objectively better in everyway
				</li>
				<li>
					An x201 thinkpad that is running EndeavourOS with bspwm (yes I know -
					I'm falling down the rabbit hole even more) - this has been upgraded
					as far as it can go (8 GB of ram let's go)
				</li>

				<li>
					An IBM x3200 M3 server (<a href="bonescallhome.html">bonescallhome</a
					>) which is no longer hosting this webpage (I really should use this
					for *something* - currently it runs nothing).
				</li>

				<li>
					An IBM x3550 M4 server (<a href="bonesrunhome.html">bonesrunhome</a>)
					which is running a few VMs (including a debian VM which is dedicated
					to web-hosting)
				</li>

				<li>
					A project that has now been put on the back burner: a Toshiba T3200 -
					this has a whopping 4MBs of ram, with a 40MB hard drive. Currently it
					isn't booting, and so my focus is to fix/replace the floppy disk drive
					(this is very much on the back burner on account of it now no longer
					turning on lol - unsure why, but it seems I may have let the magic
					smoke out- hopefully I'll fix it one day)
				</li>

				<li>
					(Is not and will never be used - if you live in perth and want it hmu
					lmao) An IBM x3650 M2 (<a href="bonescrawlhome.html">bonescrawlhome</a
					>)
				</li>

				<li>
					The most recent acquisition is an IBM (shocker)
					<a href="Power7.html"> Power 750 Express.</a>
				</li>

				<li>
					<a href="myRack.html">The server rack</a> that is currently deafening
					my living room.
				</li>

				<li>
					<a href="bonesboundhome.html">bonesboundhome</a> an IBM (yes I know)
					x3650 M4 that is being upgraded with the parts from bonesrunhome as it
					is much quieter and can support more drives/pcie expansion
				</li>

				<li>
					I also have an IBM bladecenter H, but I have no idea what I will ever
					use it for
				</li>
