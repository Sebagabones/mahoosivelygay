			<h2>My amazing rack</h2>
			<p>
				So I now have a server rack! To be honest it <em>is</em> considerably
				larger than I was expecting, but otherwise it's quite a nice server rack
				(although it is currently quite loud lmao). The long term goal with this
				is to quieten it the down, as it is probably a little loud for the
				living room
			</p>
			<p>
				My grand scheme, (well, one of them) is to swap the 240V fans out with
				some high speed be quiet! Silent Wings 4, which should hopefully provide
				enough air flow while being significantly quieter - although this will
				be probably quite a janky setup, involving a 240V >> 12V molex >> SATA
				power >> fan hub/controller >> fans lmao. I'll also probably add some
				sound deadening foam onto the sides of the case (and possibly the back
				if I can get enough airflow out of the top of the case with the fans)
